# Description.
This is a simple program that greets the user with the message "Hello!" and then prompts the user to enter their name using the input() function. 
The entered name is then stored in the variable "name" and displayed as part of a sentence "It's lovely meeting you, (name)!" . 
The program then asks for the user's age using the input() function and the entered age is stored in the variable "age". 
The program then calculates the user's age in the next year by adding 1 to the entered age and the result is displayed as a sentence "You will be (age+1) in a year."
