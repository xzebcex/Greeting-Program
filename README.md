# Introduction
The Greeting Program program is a basic script that welcomes the user with "Hello!" and invites them to input their name and age. When a user enters their name and age, the computer will answer with a personalised greeting and calculate their age in the next year.
## Usage
1.	Launch the application by entering python3 greet.py into the command line.
2.	The application will say "Hello!" to you.
3.	The application will then ask you for your name.
4.	After entering your name, the application will greet you with "It's lovely meeting you, [your name]!"
5.	You will then be prompted to provide your age.
6.	After entering your age, the software will answer, "You will be [your age + 1] in a year."
# Note
•	The script expects string inputs (name and age).
•	The age input must be a number; otherwise, an exception will be issued.
